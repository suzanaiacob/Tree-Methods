# Tree Methods

These are some short projects I made using tree-based methods: Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Random Forests, Boosted Trees.

All projects are completed in R. I am uploading both the .Rmd file and a pdf of the end notebook.

Unfortunately the data is not public and so the code cannot be run as-is.
